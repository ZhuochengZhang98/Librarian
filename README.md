# ‚ú® Key Features
- **Multimodal RAG Support**: FlexRAG isn't limited to just text-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It also supports multimodal RAG, opening up a wide range of application possibilities across different media types.
- **Diverse Data Types**: FlexRAG enables seamless integration of multiple data formats, including text (e.g., CSV, JSONL), images, documents, web snapshots, and more, giving you flexibility in working with varied data sources.
- **Unified Configuration Management**: Leveraging python `dataclass` and [hydra-core](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra), FlexRAG simplifies configuration management, making it easier to handle complex setups and customize your workflow.
- **Out-of-the-Box**: With carefully optimized default configurations, FlexRAG delivers solid performance without the need for extensive parameter tuning.
- **High Performance**: Built with persistent cache system and asynchronous methods to significantly improve speed and reduce latency in RAG workflows.
- **Research & Development Friendly**: Supports multiple development modes and includes a companion repository, [flexrag_examples](https://github.com/ictnlp/flexrag_examples), to help you reproduce various RAG algorithms with ease.
- **Lightweight**: Designed with minimal overhead, FlexRAG is efficient and easy to integrate into your project.
