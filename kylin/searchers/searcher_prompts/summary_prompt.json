Kaieteur Falls is about four and a half times the height of Niagara Falls, on the border between Canada and the United States, and about twice the height of Victoria Falls, on the border of Zambia and Zimbabwe in Africa. It is a single drop waterfall. Upriver from the falls, the Potaro Plateau stretches out to the distant escarpment of the Pakaraima Mountains. The Potaro River empties into the Essequibo River which is one of the longest and widest rivers in South America and the longest river in Guyana.\n\nQuestion: Which is the second longest river in Africa?"

It is also the world's deepest recorded river, with measured depths in excess of 220 m. The Congo-Lualaba-Chambeshi River system has an overall length of 4700 km, which makes it the world's ninth-longest river. The Chambeshi is a tributary of the Lualaba River, and Lualaba is the name of the Congo River upstream of Boyoma Falls, extending for 1800 km. Measured along with the Lualaba, the main tributary, the Congo River has a total length of 4370 km. It is the only major river to cross the equator twice. The Congo Basin has a total area of about 4000000 km2, or 13% of the entire African landmass.\n\nQuestion: Which is the second longest river in Africa?"
